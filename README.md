# TNW-clone
> What the project is about

This project consists of replicating the The Next Web website putting emphasis on how it behaves differently depending on the size of the screen where the website is rendered.

> How the project was done

The Lay out shows the basic structure of the page using empty semantic HTML elements that are appropriately sized and positioned.

Uses media queries to gracefully degrade the web page as the window size is reduced.
